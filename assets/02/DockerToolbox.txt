Getting Docker to work on Windows 10 Home
-----------------------------------------

The Docker Community Edition (CE) requires Windows 10 Pro/ Enterprise or Windows Server to
run. Windows 10 Home users must default to using the legacy version of Docker: Docker Toolbox.
Because this is a deprecated version it is riddled with bugs and glitches so getting it to
work is tricky but not impossible.

Installing Docker
--------------------------------------------------
#0: If installed on your PC, Uninstall Oracle VirtualBox. (Docker will attempt to install VMB itself and it will conflict if already installed)
#1: Go to https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/ and click "Get Docker Toolbox for Windows"
#2: Run the installer BUT DO NOT CLICK "NEXT >" YET!!!
#3: Deselect "Help Docker improve Toolbox" and click Next (This service has been deprecated and will result in errors when sending reports)
#4: Select "Docker Client for Windows", "Docker Machine for Windows", "Docker Compose for Windows" & "VirtualBox". Leave the other two options deselected. Click next.
#5: Make sure to select "Add docker binaries to PATH", "Upgrade Boot2Docker VM" & "Install VirtualBox with NDIS5 driver [Default NDIS6]". Select Create a desktop shortcut if wanted. Click next. (The NDIS6 driver will not work!!)
#6: Click install
#7: Wait for installation to finish
#8: Run "Docker Quistart Terminal"
#9: When promted, approve admin credentials and install drivers & network interfaces
#10: Pray to a God of your choosing the DQT runs succesfully and a promt with the Docker Whale appears.
	If any errors appear try Googling them and consider giving up on life.

Docker Build
------------
Open a cmd prompt in the correct directory and run
> docker build -t {TAG} .
#This command should work the same as with Docker CE

Docker Run
----------
#1: Open the Docker Toolbox Terminal
#2: Run "docker-machine stop"
#3: Opn Oracle VM VirtualBox
#4: Click the VM ('Default') and select setting
#5: Under shared folders click the 'Add new shared folder'-button on the right
#6: Enter the path to your source folder (eg 'C:/Users/JohnDoe/NotPorn/Odisee/Repo/Labo01/app')
#7: Change the name to 'labo01' and make sure 'Mount automaticly' is selected and 'Read-Only' is not!
--> In the next labo's, you can add multiple shared folders. Just name them labo02 and so on. Make sure to mount the correct volume in step 10 tho!
#8: Click OK, Click OK
#9: Return to the Docker Toolbox Terminal and enter "docker-machine start"
#10: Run "docker run -t (-d) -p {PORT}:80 -v /labo01://var/www {TAG}"
#11: Run "docker exec -it {ID} /bin/bash"
#12: Run "ls -al" and your db, public & templates folder should be there. If not, go to https://dev.foubert.eu/pieterslaatxavier/ to blow off steam.

Connecting in the browser
-------------------------
#1: Go to localhost:{PORT}
#2: Confirm this results in an error ("Connection Refused") (If this works, it's broken)
#3: Go to 192.168.99.100:{PORT}, press enter and confirm this results in a white page or content if you already changed public/index.php (DO NOT CHANGE THIS IP-ADRES! IT'S THE LINUX DEFAULT!)

Hope it works for you 'cause I spend seven hours trying to figure out what the hell was wrong with this!
